        <img src="images/quinoa-salad.jpg" alt="a plate of quinoa salad" style="object-fit: cover; border-radius: 10px; width: clamp(90vw, 70vw, 50vw); height: 100%;">
        <!-- explanation of the styles added to the image
        1. object-fit: cover-> this maintains the aspect ratio of the image while changing its width and height so it doesn't look distorted.
        2. border-radius-> this adds a bit of curve on the edge of the image to make it look more appealing and not just rectangles.
        3. clamp in the width -> takes 3 width values for small screen, medium screen and large screen. vw unit means viewport width which means the total width of your screen, be it mobile or laptop. so 90vw means 90% of the screen width. this is similar to vh which is viewport height.
        *90vw or vh is not same as 90%. 90% means that the element or image would take up 90% of its parent width or height eg
        <div style="width: 200px;">
            <img src="" alt="" style="width: 90%;">
        </div>
        *the image width would be 90% of 200px which is 180px.
        4. height: 100%-> lets the image maintain its normal height.
